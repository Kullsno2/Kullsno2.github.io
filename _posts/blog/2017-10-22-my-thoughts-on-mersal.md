What more can I say after watching this masterpiece which was brought to life by Atlee and Vijay :D Nevertheless , here I shed light upon some of the magic moments in Mersal , the movie.

## Vijay

I can never express my feelings in words when I see Thalapathy on screen.This film easily tops my favorite list of Vijay films.Vijay had a great scope for acting in this movie and as usual he danced with such passion and energy.

The Paris fight scene & the Punjab intro scene are my favorites.The flashback scene where Vetrimaran describes Aisu(Nithya Menon) to his son and the Cesarean surgery which takes place along with it.Atlee _/\_

"Aisu! ... Aisu! ... Vuttu poirathadi! ... " , Thalapathy Steals the show <3

## Cinematography

(If you watched the film in tamilrockers then simply skip this step.Thanks for reading!)

The camera work is exremely brilliant in this movie.The locations and lightings in Macho song is so good.Only Atlee can find such locations after his master Shankar.The theatre sequence when Vetrimaran enters into the theatre while tickets and papers are sprayed everywhere.Senjutan saar antha scene le.Every scene with Vetrimaran is a delight to watch.

Hey! Thanks for reading maite <3
